## Project Motivation <a name="motivation">

The goal of this project was to analyse the Indian ML and DS community.

I tried to answer four key questions:

1. What is the gender distribution in the field?
2. Do people with postgraduate degree earn more in India?
3. What job roles most Indian Kagglers have?
4. What is the age distribution of Indian Kagglers?
